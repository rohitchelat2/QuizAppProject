# Quiz App Project

This project was developed as a learning exercise and as part of my Fullstack course. The app allows users to create questions and answer them, making it a valuable tool for repetitive learning. Questions are organized by topics for better structure and focus. The app includes authentication features, enabling users to sign in as either regular users or admins. Admins have additional privileges, including the ability to add and manage topics, questions, and answers.
