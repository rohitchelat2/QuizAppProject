#Quiz App Project#
##Description##
This project was developed as a learning exercise and as part of my Fullstack course. The app allows users to create questions and answer them, making it a valuable tool for repetitive learning. Questions are organized by topics for better structure and focus. The app includes authentication features, enabling users to sign in as either regular users or admins. Admins have additional privileges, including the ability to add and manage topics, questions, and answers.

##The process##
The process of building this app was a good lurning curve for me. Each obstacle I overcame helped me learn new things. End product is not perfect and it is naive, but lessosn I got was much more valuable.
